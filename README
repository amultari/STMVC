	1.INTRODUCTION

	This application is an attempt to build a pure java framework on top of
	the groovy-based Grails web application framework. Purpose of this
	framework is to leverage Grails facilities and ease of use, while
	maintaining compatibility with all the java tools out there.


	2.SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

	In order to use STMVC, you should have Grails 1.2 > installed on your
	system. Since you are going to customize this installation, we recommend
	to have a dedicated installation of Grails for evaluation purposes.

 
	3.INSTALLATION

	3.1.Scripts installation

	The following script files are listed under /scripts directory of the
	repository

	       - _GrailsCreateArtifacts.groovy
	       - CreateJavaController.groovy
	       - CreateJavaDomainController.groovy

	The _GrailsCreateArtifacts.groovy is a custom version of the standard
	Grails' _GrailsCreateArtifacts.groovy script. You should put it in your
	$GRAILS_HOME/scripts directory thus overwriting the standard one (even
	if we guarantee backward compatibility with standard grails behavior,
	create a backup first). CreateJavaController.groovy and
	CreateJavaDomainClass.groovy may be put in either $GRAILS_HOME/scripts
	or your specific $GRAILS_PROJECT_ROOT/scripts directory.

	3.2.Templates installation

	The following template files are listed under /src/template/artifacts
	directory of the repository

	       - JavaController.groovy
	       - JavaDomainController.groovy

	These files may be put in either
	$GRAILS_HOME/src/grails/templates/artifacts or your specific
	$GRAILS_PROJECT_ROOT/src/templates/artifacts directory.


	4.USAGE
	
	STMVC is intended to be used the same way Grails is. The only difference
	relies in that you can now create full-fledged JPA compliant java domain
	classes and plain annotated java Spring MVC Controllers for your web
	application. In order to do that, Grails standard script set has been
	augmented with these two new scripts

	      -grails create-java-domain-class foo.bar.EntityName
	      -grails create-java-controller foo.bar.EntityName

	In this version of STMVC, a java controller for foo.bar.EntityName will
	be created in the package foo.controller with the name
	EntityController. We encourage than to use a naming convention for which
	entities reside in a package like foo.model, in order to have the
	following structure

		  foo
		   |
		   +-model
		   |
		   +-controller
